BrightnessImgCharMatcher:

1.I used a hashMap in BrightnessImgCharMatcher, so that each char can be mapped to a brightness.
I perdered to use chars as the keys instead of image because image can be change at another call 
not just when thre is a larger or difreent char in set chars but also in diferrent parametr of 
charsInRow therefore I used Map of cahrs and float and each calcoulation I sent the linerstretch 
function and the imageBritness function as arguments.
by that we calculate regrards to the images again but it is is better because the chances  is low
and therfore we save ourself from removing the images every call when the numCharsInRow is different
If we need the brightness of a char which was not yet calculated and added to the hashMap,
then we calculate by using the linaerstretch function again and add to map.
Also since it takes o(1) on average to check if a char was mapped yet or not, this is very efficient.

2.I used a hashSet for characters in Shell, to insure there would not be duplicates.

3. I made an Iterator in specific for both type: pixels and images
   and that for the ability to move by the roles and by the fit size of each type 
if it is 1 by one or some size by some size.
for implement it I created a new class which impements the interface image and a new class which
implements the inteface of Iterable and by sending the class of an image whith the coreespending size
we will be able to run on it easily
